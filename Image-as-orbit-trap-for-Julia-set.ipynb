    "  Orbit trap is a method to assign color to pixels in  a Julia  or Mandelbrot set, described shortly in Inigo Quilez articles, posted on his web page. There are two types of orbit traps, geometric orbit traps\n",
    "[https://iquilezles.org/articles/ftrapsgeometric/(https://iquilezles.org/articles/ftrapsgeometric/), and (raster) image orbit traps [https://iquilezles.org/articles/ftrapsbitmap/](https://iquilezles.org/articles/ftrapsbitmap/). \n",
    "In this repo is implemented the Julia set generated by an orbit trap defined by an image.\n",
    "It works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Julia set fractal is included in a rectangular region,  `[xmin, xmax] x [ymin,ymax]`, from the complex plane.  Over this rectangle is defined a meshgrid of resolution `Nrow x Ncol`. The mesh points will be the pixels in the fractal image. The trapping set is another rectangle,  `[a,b] x [c,d]`, included in, or overlapping the first one, chosen by user through experimentation. Theoretically on the latter rectangle   is defined  a meshgrid of the same resolution like the image resolution, to ensure   a one-to-one correspondence between the points of the  meshgrid and the image pixels.\n",
    "If $f(z)$ is a complex valued  function that defines a Julia set (usually $f(z)=z^2+c$, $c\\in \\mathbb{C}$), then for each mesh point, $z$, in the fractal rectangle, the iterates, $f^n(z)$, are calculated, and  tests are performed to detect escape time from the disk, $D(0, 2)$,  and moreover, tests for each point of an orbit, whether it entered the trap (the rectangle `[a,b]x[c,d]`). If this is a case, and (i,j) are the  indices of the nearest pixel in the trap to the first trapped orbit point,   then to the position of the orbit  initial point, in the  fractal image, one assigns that trap pixel color.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code given below  works both for images with removed background (e.g. images with transparent background, and for general images.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the background is removed, and the orbit is in fact trapped, but the first orbit point in the trap corresponds to a transparent pixel (i.e. it is not a pixel on the shape represented by that image),  it is considered as an untrapped point (see the function `trapped`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in the next cell generates the first Julia set displayed in README.md. The orbit trap is an AI generated image with transparent background (set via fotor [https://www.fotor.com/features/background-remover](https://www.fotor.com/features/background-remover)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Then a few Julia sets are displayed, giving the orbit trap and the corresponding  complex function. "
